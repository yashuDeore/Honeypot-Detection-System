Honeypot-Detection 🕵️‍♂️🔍
A simple honeypot system to detect unauthorized access attempts and log attacker activities.

📌 Project Purpose
Cybersecurity threats are increasing daily, and attackers constantly scan networks for vulnerabilities. This honeypot acts as a decoy system to:
✅ Attract attackers and collect intelligence
✅ Log intrusion attempts for analysis
✅ Send real-time alerts on unauthorized access
✅ Strengthen network security by identifying attack patterns

This project can be used in penetration testing, security research, and learning cybersecurity concepts.

⚙️ Installation Steps
Follow these steps to install and run the honeypot:

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
Open Terminal / Git Bash and run:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Honeypot-Detection.git
cd Honeypot-Detection
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install required packages:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Run the Honeypot
Start the honeypot service:
python honeypot.py
The system will now start listening for unauthorized access attempts.

4️⃣ Monitor Logs
Check attack logs in honeypot_log.txt:

bash
cat honeypot_log.txt
5️⃣ Enable Real-Time Alerts (If Implemented)
To receive alerts (via email, Telegram, or Discord), configure the config.py file with your credentials.


🛠️ How It Works
1️⃣ The honeypot listens on specific ports (e.g., SSH, HTTP, FTP).
2️⃣ When an attacker scans or interacts with the fake service, their IP, request type, and timestamp are logged.
3️⃣ If enabled, alerts are sent via email, webhook, or Telegram bot.
4️⃣ Security teams can analyze the logs to understand attack patterns and block threats.

📌 Example Log Entry
csharp
[2025-04-02 03:14:27] Unauthorized login attempt detected from 192.168.1.105 on port 22 (SSH)
(You can add a sample screenshot of the logs!)
